# SMOTERE
A Method based on Oversampling and Ensemble Learning for Predicting the Number of Software Defects

> Abstract: Predicting the number of the defects in software modules can help researchers make good use of the testing resource by paying more attention on the modules with more defects. Focusing on the issue that software defect dataset is imbalanced, a method SMOTERE based on oversampling and ensemble learning is proposed in this paper. First, get n balance datasets by oversampling original software defect dataset n times. Then train the n balance datasets using regression algorithms and get n weak prediction models. Finally, combine these models to be a strong prediction model and predict new software modules using the strong model. The result shows that SMOTERE improves the accuracy of prediction obviously.

This project is the code of my paper 'A Method based on Oversampling and Ensemble Learning for Predicting the Number of Software Defects'.
